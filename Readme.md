## üìö Home Library

Home library is a tool for managing and organizing a home book collection. Each of us has at least a dozen or so books in our collection. If we start exchanging books with more than one group of friends, it is easy to lose or forget a book. Due to our application you will remember to whom and when you borrowed the book. You will know if any of your friends has a book that interests you in their library. 
We invite you to try our app at [https://home-library-spio.herokuapp.com](https://floating-brushlands-92561.herokuapp.com/).
